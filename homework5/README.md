## Task2
- Use lanes' left-bound and right-bound's starting and ending points to decide which routes are connected.

- Use the following command to run: `bazel run //homework5:GetPredSucc_main`
- `processed_map_proto.txt` can be found in `/homework5/Results/Map/`

##Task3
- Use predecessor information generated by Task2 to generate a graph. Use BFS algorithm to search shortest way between start and end point.
- Source files are: `FindRoute.cc`, `FindRoute.h`, `FindRoute_main.cc`
- Use the following command to run: `bazel run //homework5:FindRoute_main`
- All the result proto files and pictures can be found in `/homework5/Results/Route/`
